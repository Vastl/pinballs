# pinballs
A full-stack app for hosting 3D Pinball: Space Cadet tournaments. Includes a frontend for leaderboards, a backend for score tracking, and a C# client that runs the game, reads scores from the registry, and submits them. Discord bot integration provides real-time tournament updates (coming soon).
